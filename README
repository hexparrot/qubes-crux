USING CRUX AS A QUBES VIRTUAL MACHINE
------------------------------------------

The current steps will help you install CRUX as a TemplateVM in Qubes.
The following features are currently implemented:

* dom0 I/O and cross-vm copy-paste
* qvm-* commands
* mounts private drive (xvdb)
* working audio
* ships with Firefox
* HVM, PVH, PV

Currently not working:

* firewall rules from dom0
* automatically handle xvd* size changes


INSTALLATION STEPS
------------------------------------------

General idea:

1) Download the CRUX ISO, and boot a new Qube from the ISO.
2) Get the internet working on the new qube, then download these helper scripts.
3) Run the helpers scripts to install CRUX to your permanent system (xvda3),
build a minimal kernel, and build all Qubes components.
4) Reboot and test operation.
5) Clone Standalone to TemplateVM, create AppVM.

Ensure this Qube has enough memory to compile a kernel, e.g., 2048MB.
You can reduce the usage of the AppVM later.

Specifics:

Start a StandaloneVM (HVM) 'crux', booting with the CRUX ISO.
Type 'CRUX' to enter the installation environment.

# export IP=10.137.0.x   [get x from Qube Settings:IP]
# export GW=10.137.0.y   [get y from Qube Settings:Gateway]
# export DEV=eth0

# ifconfig $DEV up
# ip route add $GW dev $DEV
# ip route add default via $GW
# ip addr add $IP/32 dev $DEV
# ip link set $DEV up

# echo 'nameserver 10.139.1.1' >> /etc/resolv.conf

# wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/hexparrot/qubes-crux/tarball/master
# tar -xf master
# cd hexparrot*/helpers
# ./00_full_install
# reboot

And you're done! It's a working qube, perfect for DispVMs or main use
by installing additional software using CRUX' ports system. See prt-get.

To turn this StandaloneVM to a Template VM, in dom0:

$ qvm-clone --class TemplateVM crux crux_template

For using PV/PVH mode, in dom0:

$ cd /var/lib/qubes/vm-kernels
$ qvm-run -p crux 'cat /usr/ports/qubes-crux/helpers/kernel.tar.gz' | tar xzf -

ADDITIONAL NOTES
------------------------------------------

Be sure to read and review the scripts you are executing!

00_full_install is a convenience script that runs every other script
in the helpers/ directory: everything from automating the partitioning of xvda
to copying over system packages, to git-cloning & compiling qubes components.

CRUX requires a custom-built kernel by design at installation-time. 
A minimal kernel config has been provided here under my authorship.
It includes everything necessary for audio and video playback in Firefox,
but there are likely a large number of otherwise useful modules that haven't
made the cut.

You can easily customize the kernel after the installation is complete,
or you can do so before the first reboot. Instead of 00_full_install:

...
# cd hexparrot*/helpers
# ./10_prepare_disk
# ./20_install_packages
# ./30_qubes_config
# ./manual_kernel_build
# exit  #[exit the chroot]
# ./50_qubes_build
# reboot

If for any reason you want direct access to the chroot, CRUX' ISO provides
a shortcut that'll handle mounting of the host /dev for you:

# setup-chroot

KNOWN ISSUES
------------------------------------------

Difficulties with dracut interfering with having full support for xvdc
(swap) and xvda resizing.

PACKAGING SYSTEM
------------------------------------------

CRUX uses the ports system, which is a source-based package manager.
You can see all the qubes-related ports in this repo and all the commands
used to easily reproduce packages for installation. See the CRUX handbook
for more details.

This package will soon be versioned for Qubes 4 and modified to work with
the upcoming Qubes4.1 (which will require new ports altogether).

If anybody has any expertise in the qubes-builder system, your help would
be absolutely invaluable.
